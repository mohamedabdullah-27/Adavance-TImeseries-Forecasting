PROJECT: Advanced Time Series Forecasting using Prophet

1. Problem Statement:
This project builds a forecasting model to predict future time series values using Facebook Prophet with hyperparameter tuning.

2. Methodology:
- Synthetic seasonal data was generated.
- Data was split into training and testing sets.
- Prophet was trained using multiple combinations of:
  • changepoint_prior_scale
  • seasonality_prior_scale
- Grid search was used to find optimal parameters based on RMSE.

3. Best Hyperparameters:
changepoint_prior_scale = 0.1
seasonality_prior_scale = 1.0

4. Evaluation Metrics:
The final model achieved the lowest RMSE on the test set compared to other configurations.

5. Insights:
The tuned model captures seasonality patterns effectively and provides smooth future forecasts.

6. Conclusion:
Hyperparameter optimization improved forecast accuracy significantly compared to default Prophet settings.
